# CS-250
## Sprint Review and Retrospective
This repository includes the sprint review and retrospective document from my CS 250 course, which demonstrates the Agile and Scrum practices applied throughout the development process.

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs requires understanding the business goals, gathering requirements and converting them into actionable development tasks. User stories help by breaking down complex requirements into smaller manageable pieces that developers can implement. They ensure that each feature aligns with user expectations and allows for continuous feedback and iteration.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I follow an iterative approach focusing on continuous development, testing and feedback. Agile processes such as backlog refinement, sprint planning and regular retrospectives help me stay organized and adaptable. In future projects, I plan to integrate automated testing, maintain clear documentation and use backlog prioritization to ensure efficient development.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member communicates effectively, collaborates with others, and adapts to changes. Being open to feedback, supporting teammates and ensuring that all contributions align with project goals are key aspects of teamwork. Strong documentation, active participation in discussions and responsiveness to changes improve overall team performance and project success.
